## Hey there! ðŸ˜º
I'm Nerea, a Japanese Studies graduate, with a master in Japanese Art. I amcurrently enrolled in 42 Madrid's computer science campus, learning and getting ready to face a new adventure! 
I hope to mix this new knowledge with my previous experiences.

I am currently focused on learning C programming and Unix system administration, but I've also got a keen interest in cybersecurity. Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
